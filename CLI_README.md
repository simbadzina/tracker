## Status Values

- **`successful`**: Day was successful (green in calendar)

## Security

- **AWS Credentials**: Uses your AWS access keys for DynamoDB access
- **Environment Variables**: Store credentials securely in `.env` file
- **Never Share**: Keep your AWS credentials secret and secure
- **IAM Permissions**: Ensure your AWS user has appropriate DynamoDB permissions

## Examples

### Mark Today as Successful
```bash
python cli.py mark $(date +%Y-%m-%d) successful
```

### Mark Yesterday as Unsuccessful
```bash
python cli.py mark $(date -d "yesterday" +%Y-%m-%d) unsuccessful
```

### View Your Progress
```bash
python cli.py show
python cli.py status
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" or "Unauthorized"
- Ensure you have a `.env` file with AWS credentials
- Check that `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are set
- Verify your AWS user has DynamoDB permissions
- Restart your terminal after creating `.env`

### "Table not found"
- Ensure the DynamoDB table exists
- Check that `DYNAMODB_TABLE` is set correctly in `.env`
- Verify the table name matches exactly

### "Region not found"
- Check that `AWS_REGION` is set correctly
- Ensure the region exists and is accessible
